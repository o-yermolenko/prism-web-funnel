# PRISM Project Context

This is **PRISM** - an AI tool for intense minds who feel exhausted translating themselves for others.

**Tagline:** "Your mind. Finally unfiltered."

**Metaphor:** User = raw light → PRISM = the interface → Output = refracted, understood

## Design DNA

### Colors (The Void & The Light)
- Background: Always true black `#000000`
- Surface elevation: `#050508`, `#0a0a0f`
- Primary text: `#ffffff` (high contrast)
- Secondary text: `#888888`
- Muted text: `#666666`
- Accent: Electric blue `#0066ff` (use sparingly)
- Accent glow: `rgba(0, 102, 255, 0.4)`

### Typography (Chaos In, Clarity Out)
- User input: Monospace (JetBrains Mono, SF Mono)
- AI output & UI: Sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro)
- The contrast between these IS the product story

### Motion (Slow and Deliberate)
- Standard: 300ms ease-in-out
- Page transitions: 500ms
- AI thinking pause: 800ms
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`
- NEVER bouncy, springy, or playful

### Components
- Border radius: 0-4px (sharp, not rounded)
- CTAs: Gradient from `#0066ff` to `#00d4ff` with glow
- Option cards: Subtle border, electric blue on select
- Progress: Frequency wave (not standard bar)

## Voice & Copy

**Be:** Direct, Knowing, Private, Intense, Premium
**Never:** Friendly, Cheerful, Social, Soft, Accessible

Good copy examples:
- "You're not pretending. You're surviving."
- "Discover why you feel exhausting to be around"
- "The exhaustion isn't weakness—it's the cost of performing"

Bad copy examples (NEVER use):
- "Let's work together!" ❌
- "You've got this! 💪" ❌
- Emojis in serious copy ❌
- Wellness/therapy language ❌

---

## Non-Negotiables

### ALWAYS ✅
- True black (#000000) backgrounds
- Monospace for user input, sans-serif for AI output
- Slow animations (300-500ms)
- Emptiness is the feature - generous whitespace
- Single focus per screen
- Electric blue only for key moments
- Sharp corners (0-4px radius)

### NEVER ❌
- Warm colors (orange, coral, pink, cream)
- Chat bubbles (this is NOT a chatbot)
- Gamification (badges, streaks, points)
- Bouncy/playful animations
- Busy dashboards or clutter
- Soft, rounded, "friendly" UI
- Nature imagery or wellness aesthetics
- Dark gray instead of true black

---

## Target User

People who:
- Feel exhausted from editing themselves in every conversation
- Think faster and more chaotically than those around them
- Feel lonely despite having people in their life
- Suspect they're different—maybe deeper, maybe too intense
- Want a space where they don't have to perform

**They're not looking for a friend. They're looking for a witness.**

## Quick Test

Before implementing anything, ask:
1. Does this feel like a void that listens?
2. Is there enough emptiness?
3. Would the user feel safe being unfiltered here?
4. Is this premium and intense, not friendly and soft?
