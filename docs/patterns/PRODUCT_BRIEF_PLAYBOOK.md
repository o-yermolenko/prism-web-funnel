# Universal Product Brief Playbook

> A framework for decomposing any product to its emotional core—understanding not just what it does, but why it matters to the humans who use it.

---

## How to Use This Playbook

This playbook helps you reverse-engineer any product's soul. Use it to:
- **Study competitors** - Understand what makes them resonate (or fail to)
- **Analyze successful products** - Extract principles you can apply
- **Define your own products** - Build from emotional truth, not features

**Process:**
1. Experience the product as a user (sign up, use it, feel it)
2. Read their marketing, about page, founder interviews
3. Fill out each section below
4. Look for contradictions between what they say and what they do

---

## Part 1: The Soul

### 1.1 Product Identity

```
Product Name: 
One-liner: [What they say they are in <10 words]
Website: 
Category: [e.g., productivity, wellness, finance, social]
```

### 1.2 The Tagline Test

> The tagline reveals what the company believes about their user.

```
Official Tagline: 
What it promises: 
What it implies about the user: 
```

**Analysis questions:**
- Does the tagline speak to a pain or an aspiration?
- Is it about the product or about the user?
- What emotion does it try to evoke?

### 1.3 The Core Metaphor

> Every great product has an implicit metaphor that shapes everything.

```
The user is: [What/who does the product see the user as?]
The product is: [What role does the product play?]
The transformation is: [What does the user become?]
```

**Examples:**
- PRISM: User = raw light → Product = prism → Output = refracted, understood
- Notion: User = builder → Product = legos → Output = custom system
- Headspace: User = turbulent mind → Product = guide → Output = calm presence

### 1.4 Brand Essence (One Sentence)

> Capture the emotional truth of the product in one sentence.

```
[Product] exists because _________________________________.
```

**Good examples:**
- "PRISM exists because intense minds deserve a space where they don't have to translate themselves."
- "Notion exists because people want to build systems that work exactly how their brain works."
- "Calm exists because the world is too loud and people are desperate for permission to slow down."

---

## Part 2: The User

### 2.1 Target User Profile

> Not demographics. Psychology.

**Who are they?**
```
They are people who:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
```

**What do they secretly believe about themselves?**
```
They suspect they are:
- 
- 
```

**What are they tired of?**
```
They're exhausted by:
- 
- 
- 
```

### 2.2 The User's Hidden Pain

> The pain they'll admit vs. the pain that actually drives them.

```
Surface pain (what they'll say): 

Deep pain (what they won't say): 

Deepest pain (what they might not even know): 
```

**Example (PRISM):**
- Surface: "I need help organizing my thoughts"
- Deep: "People don't understand me and it's exhausting"
- Deepest: "Maybe I'm too much. Maybe something is wrong with me."

### 2.3 The User's Hidden Desire

> What transformation do they actually want?

```
Surface desire (what they'll say): 

Deep desire (what they won't say): 

Deepest desire (what they might not even know): 
```

**Example (PRISM):**
- Surface: "I want to communicate better"
- Deep: "I want to be understood without having to try so hard"
- Deepest: "I want proof that my intensity is valuable, not broken"

### 2.4 The Relationship They Want

> What role does the user want the product to play in their life?

```
The user is NOT looking for: [e.g., a friend, a coach, a judge]
The user IS looking for: [e.g., a witness, a tool, a partner]
```

**Common relationship archetypes:**
- **Witness** - "See me without judging me"
- **Coach** - "Push me to be better"
- **Companion** - "Be with me on this journey"
- **Tool** - "Do exactly what I tell you, efficiently"
- **Expert** - "Tell me what I don't know"
- **Mirror** - "Show me myself more clearly"

## Appendix: Example Analysis

### Minimal Example: Headspace

```
ESSENCE:

permission + guidance to pause."

User = overwhelmed mind → Headspace = friendly guide → Output = calm clarity

TARGET USER:
People who know they "should" meditate but find it intimidating, 
who feel guilty about not taking care of themselves, 
who want self-improvement to feel achievable, not aspirational.

THEY WANT:
To feel like they're doing something good for themselves without it 
feeling like another obligation.

RELATIONSHIP:
A friendly guide, not a guru. Approachable, not enlightened.

VOICE:
Warm, Simple, Encouraging, Gentle, British-tinged

DESIGN:
- Soft, rounded, approachable (nothing sharp or intimidating)
- Illustration over photography (abstracted, less pressure)
- Orange/coral warmth (calming but energizing)

NEVER:
- Spiritual/religious imagery
- Intense or demanding language
- Cold, clinical, medical aesthetic
- Complicated instructions

FEELING:
Using Headspace should feel like a kind friend gently reminding you 
to breathe—no judgment, just support.
```

## Tips for Deep Analysis

1. **Experience before analyzing** - Use the product. Sign up. Go through their funnel. Feel it.

2. **Read founder interviews** - The origin story often reveals the emotional core.

3. **Look at what they DON'T do** - Absence is design. What's missing is intentional.

4. **Find the contradiction** - Every product has a gap between aspiration and reality.

5. **Talk to users** - Reddit, Twitter, reviews. What do users love? What frustrates them?

6. **Compare to competitors** - Difference illuminates identity.

7. **Trust your gut** - If something feels off-brand, it probably is. Document why.
