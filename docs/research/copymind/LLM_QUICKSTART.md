```

### Problem Agitation Sequence
```
"What worries you?" 
  → Lists 11 problems
  → "92% fail at goals"
  → "HIGH RISK of decision paralysis"
  → Shows declining trajectory chart
  → "You struggle with stress, overthinking..."
```

### Solution Desire Building
```
"Building your AI Mind" (37%)
  → Keeps working... (74%)
  → Profile metrics shown
  → "Readiness Score: HIGH" (you're ready!)

## RED FLAGS & ISSUES TO FIX

### If Replicating, DON'T Copy These Mistakes:

1. ❌ **Don't claim "1-minute"** when it's 8 minutes (trust violation)
2. ❌ **Fix text encoding** (they have spacing issues throughout)
3. ❌ **Don't hide auto-renewal** in fine print (ethical issue)
4. ❌ **Don't use vague research** ("COPYMIND Team research" lacks credibility)
5. ❌ **Don't skip social login** (add Google/Apple options)

### Improvements to Make:

1. ✅ **Add free trial tier** (3-day trial + 3 paid options)
2. ✅ **Show more value on paywall** (feature list, testimonials)
3. ✅ **Exit-intent popup** on abandonment
4. ✅ **Email earlier option** (capture at 50% with partial results)
5. ✅ **Live chat** on pricing page (answer objections)

---

## ESTIMATED BUILD TIME

### For Experienced Team:
- **Design:** 1-2 weeks (34 unique pages)
- **Frontend Development:** 2-3 weeks (components, routing, state)
- **Backend Integration:** 1 week (API, email, payment)
- **Content Creation:** 3-5 days (questions, copy, images)
- **Testing & QA:** 1 week (cross-browser, mobile, edge cases)
- **Total:** 6-8 weeks

### For Solo Developer:
- **Full-stack build:** 8-12 weeks
- **Using template/framework:** 4-6 weeks
- **Using no-code (Typeform + Zapier):** 1-2 weeks *(but less customization)*

---

## MONETIZATION MATH

### Example Projections (1000 visitors/month):

```
1000 visitors
  ↓ 35% email conversion
350 emails captured
  ↓ 12% purchase conversion  
42 customers @ €19.99/month
= €839.58 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

If 50% stay 3+ months:
= €1,679 total revenue per 1000 visitors
= €1.68 revenue per visitor
```

**Implication:** Can profitably spend up to €1.50 per visitor on ads

---
